        <div class="subheading mb-5">Digital Marketer üñ•Ô∏è</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current UCR freshman student, hoping to switch to a pre-business major and concentrate in marketing. My goal is to be in digital marketing after graduating in 2027. Marketing, advertising, and the psychology of marketing/business interests me, hence, getting a career centered in one of those things would be a dream. I went to John Marshall High School and there I joined Link Crew and the Student Advisory Board at the Health Center. These clubs helped me step out of my comfort zone when it came to speaking to others in a public setting. Communicating eloquently when informing and expressing ideas is an important characteristic a person should have when striving to be in the business industry. Just as I stepped out of my comfort zone in High School, I want to step out of my comfort at UCR. I want to learn how to communicate at a professional level, publicly speak with ease, and ultimately become more of an extrovert. 
<br><br>

        What sparked my interest in business and marketing was seeing how my dad carried about his business. Having to provide for our family, endlessly trying to make ends meet, drove him to start a business and sell his service of carpet cleaning. I‚Äôve seen the struggle and difficulties of running a business. He‚Äôs unknowingly been teaching me the ends and outs of a business, from customer service to negotiating prices. My dad has always strived to learn more about running businesses and has recently been able to expand his professionalism by creating social media platforms. What has recently captured his interest, and my attention, is advertising his business on social media by publishing Ads to the right audience for more clients. He unintentionally introduced me to the world of digital marketing and my attention was captured. There is so much to learn about when it comes to advertising and the processes behind reaching the right audience. Small businesses have grown because of their marketing teams. To be part of a marketing team for a brand and experience the behind the scenes of how a product or service is being launched would be a memorable experience. 
<br><br>

       My overall goal at UCR is to expand my horizons and learn as much as I can about my major. I hope to make lots of connections and push myself to be the best of who I can be. Along the way I could be introduced to other professions or classes and maybe even minoring in something else I find interesting other than business or marketing. I want to learn more and take advantage of the opportunities at UCR, but it all starts with my initiative. Joining clubs, doing research, and talking with my advisor is the first step into getting outside of the box I‚Äôve slowly placed myself in. Making more friends, talking to others about what they know and what they plan to do with their degree, and chatting with professors for more ideas and insight are other ways for me to step out of my comfort zone. Although, digital marketing is one aspect of marketing that I would like to learn more about, I would also like to get to know more about the other career paths of a marketing concentration. I am also open minded about other business concentrations and the other careers I‚Äôve yet to know about.
